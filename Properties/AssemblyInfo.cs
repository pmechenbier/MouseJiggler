A utility to continuously jiggle the mouse pointer to prevent screen saver activation. Tick the 'Enable jiggle' checkbox to begin jiggling the mouse; untick it to stop. The 'Zen jiggle' checkbox enables a mode in which the pointer is jiggled 'virtually' - the system believes it to be moving and thus screen saver activation, etc., is prevented, but the pointer does not actually move.")]
